Instructions for using the Initiative Tool by Adam Holbrook

GENERAL

"Campaigns" can be saved in .ini format to any directory selected by the user.  This can useful when organizing different events or managing several different games.

ENCOUNTER MENU

This menu contains the list of encounters in the current campaign.  Current version does not support spaces in the names of encounters; if an encounter is added with a space in the name it will be removed before it is saved.

COMBATANT MENU

--PARTY
Names in the Party list will be added to the list of names in every encounter by default.

--ENCOUNTER
This is the list of combatants in the currently selected encounter.  Names can be added to or removed from the encounter list at any time.

DURING ENCOUNTERS

--SETUP
To set initiative for a combatant, click the combatants name, type the value, and press the 'ENTER' key.  Any combatant with no initiative set will be skipped in the turn rotation; this is useful for combatants that may enter the encounter late or that have been defeated.  Initiatives can be set during the turn rotation.

--MANAGING ENCOUNTERS
When the encounter begins, pressing the 'Start' button will check the name with the highest initiative, denoting their turn.  A pop-up that can be dragged will be created that displays the current turn and the turn that is coming up.  This is useful for Game Masters or use on a secondary monitor for players.  Current version does not support turning off the pop-up.
To move to the next turn press the 'Next' button, to move back to the previous turn press the 'Back' button.

To destroy the pop-up and clear the tool's GUI, press the 'End' button.
